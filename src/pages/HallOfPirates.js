					<h1>Disclaimer</h1>
					<p>This project was built to develop my skills and intended for fun - not as a means to make money.</p>
					<p>Please do not gamble more than you have. If you are in a jurisdiction that does not allow this type of gameplay, please do not participate.</p>
					<p>There is no guarantee that this website will always remain open, or that the contract will work as indended - so please do not spend more than you are willing to lose.</p>
					<p>The price "for the throne" should remain cheap, but in the event there is ever a sharp increase in the price of Fantom, then the owner is allowed to change the price.</p>
					<p>I have no intention of making money off of this project, but, as the owner, I am permitted to withdraw all funds from the contract - this is a procaution to avoid funds being stuck.</p>
					<p>In the event that this project wants to continue beyond my interest, the owner of the project can change.</p>
